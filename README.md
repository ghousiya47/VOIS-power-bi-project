# **An Analysis of Unemployment in Republic of India**

In my project I have done analysis on dataset “**Unemployment in Republic of India**”, which is a excel file. 
It consists of the following 4 key columns: 
 
   - Gender 
 
 - Unemployed (count)
 
 - Age (range of age like 16 to 19 years)
 
 - Period (date format like 20 january 2007)

I have performed following tasks in my project using power bi application:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

  * Cleaned and standardized data types.
    
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

**3. Insights:**
